# WFireOutcomeWork
Prepare wildfire perimeter boundary files.
The main purpose of the code is to merge MTBS wildfire perimeters from 1984 - 2017,
with similar data from GEOMACS for 2018 and 2019.

Each perimater is cleaned and a spatial filter of WUI pixels used to discard wildfire 
perimeters which don't impact urban areas.
